Ideas for Plugins
=================

 Plugin: GoogleTest

 - Jump to next/previous test using ]t and [t
 - Add new test template (normal, fixture, typed, parameterized) -> Snippet?
 - Define test binary
 - Run test under cursor in floating window
 - Run test under cursor in tabline
 - Run all tests 
 - Deliver test binary / test name (complete call) for e.g. DAP

 Plugin: Navigation

 - Scan the window environment (NVimTree, Vista, main windows)
 - Go to NVimTree, Vista
 - Switch between main windows
 - Go to tab using CTRL-1 - CTRL-0 (tab #1 - #10)
 - Move tab to the left / right
 - Show floating window with open tabs and buffers
 - NvimTree: autocommands for close

 Plugin: Projects

 - Organize NeoVim projects
 - Store settings in JSON file(s) (project name, LSP compile_commands.json, DAP, etc)

 Plugin: TODO
